## Important Notes

- **Avoid using GitHub and GitLab simultaneously**: To prevent conflicts and ensure a streamlined workflow, it is recommended to use either GitHub or GitLab, but not both concurrently within the same project.

- **Review all MCP documentation prior to configuration**: Before configuring any MCP server, thoroughly read its documentation to understand any specific requirements, such as API key scopes or permissions. This ensures proper setup and avoids potential issues during integration.
